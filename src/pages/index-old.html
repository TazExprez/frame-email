<!-- layout: promotional is how we let Panini know that we are using the promotional layout.  This is a variable. -->
<!-- subject is another variable. -->
<!-- You can add variables in the section that layout and subject are located in.  The variables will show up inside of our email. -->
<!-- Using this is great because if we want to reuse the same layout later on, we just need to change the values for the variables on the top for many changes. -->

<!-- The container is going to be the maximum width that the email is going to be. -->
<!-- You always want a container wrapping around your grid system or any type of content that you are creating. -->

  <row>
    <columns small="12" large="12">home</columns>

  <row class="collapse"> -->
    <!-- As long as the columns add up to 12, you are going to be fine and are going to be able to control everything, however you want it. -->
    <!-- <columns small="6" large="6">about</columns>
    <columns small="6" large="6">contact</columns>
  </row>
  <row> -->
    <!-- The offset is used to move the column.  Here the column has a width of 4 on large screens, so it needs an offset of 8, if we want to move it all the way to the right. -->
    <!-- <columns small="12" large="4" class="large-offset-8">shop</columns> -->
    <!-- Now we also set the column width to 4 on small screens and added an offset of 8. -->
    <!-- <columns small="4" large="4" class="large-offset-8 small-offset-8">shop</columns> -->
    <!-- Now the small screen column width is 6 and the offset for small screens is set to 6.  Now the column for small screens starts at the halfway point. -->

  <!-- Then you have a row to divide the different sections. -->
  <row class="collapse header">
    <!-- Then we have our columns.  Within the columns, we can change things like padding.  We can change the different types of spacing if we'd like. -->
