<!-- After everything is done and you use npm run build, go into the dist folder.  This folder is where everything gets compiled to.  When you look at the index.html file in here, you will notice that everything is inlined and minified.  Select everything inside of the index.html file and copy it.  Then paste this into the template area in Mailchimp, or some other email platform.

<!-- When you are doing a mobile preview in Mailchimp, sometimes things may appear to not align properly.  This is usually happening becuase Mailchimp decides to use a much smaller screen size than it's supposed to.  Don't pay attention to that because this particular email will work perfectly on your phone. -->

<!-- When Joe first sent the Mailchimp email to himself, it had issues.  The images of the countries were not being shown.  I did not have any issues and these images were showing for me.  Sometimes you cannot see the element and need to open up the browser window as much as possible.  Joe found the <img> with the appropriate src, but for whatever reason, it did not go through.  The issue Joe was having was that he forgot to put https: before the rest of the content in the src attributes in the <img>s. -->

<!-- After the code is minified and ready to go, you can always go back and add some if statements in order to make it work with some email clients.  You can do this by unminifying the code using a site like unminify.com to make the code easier to work with. -->

<!-- Using frameworks, like Foundation, is great because you normally just have to change the content area and leave other parts of the email unchanged.  This will speed up your process considerably. -->
